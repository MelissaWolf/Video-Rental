To add a new Rental you will need to follow the following steps:

You will need to select the Customers ID in the Customer Tab. Then change to the Rental Tab and enter the Movie ID.
Then click the button Movie Out; it will tell you the price the customer will be needing to pay.
When you rent out a movie and return it with the current time stored.

Note: I assume you have correctly labeled all the movies with their ID's on the side. If you have not please do this!
